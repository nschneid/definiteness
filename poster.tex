%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Abstract%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Abstract}{name=abstract,column=0,row=0,span=1.15}{
Definiteness expresses a constellation of semantic, pragmatic, and discourse properties (the communicative functions) of an NP. Our supervised classifier for English NPs uses lexical, morphological, and syntactic features to predict the communicative functions in terms of a language-universal classification scheme and establishes strong baselines for future work. Additionally, analysis of the features and learned parameters in the model provides insight into the grammaticalization of definiteness in English, not all of which is obvious a priori.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Classification Model}{name=model,column=0,span=1.15,below=abstract}{
We use an in-house implementation of a multiclass logistic regression classifier.\\ %(logistic regression allows us to analyze the feature weights and hence generate hypotheses regarding form-function interactions).
\\{\bf Feature function:}
\begin{align*}\mathbf{f}(x,y) = \boldsymbol{\phi}(x) \times \tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}(y)
\end{align*}

{\bf Feature weight vector:}
\begin{align*}
\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} = \arg \max_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}-{\lambda} ||\boldsymbol{\theta}||^2_2 + \sum_{\langle x,y \rangle\in\mathcal{D}} \log{\frac{\exp{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\top}\mathbf{f}(x,y)}}{\sum_{y' \in \mathcal{Y}}\exp{\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\top}\mathbf{f}(x,y')\right)}}}
\end{align*}
